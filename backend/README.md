# Kohos Backend

Backend services for the Kohos platform, including database management and API functions.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

This backend uses Supabase as the primary database and backend-as-a-service solution.

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
- **profiles** - Base user profiles with authentication data
- **creator_profiles** - Creator-specific data (followers, engagement, etc.)
- **brand_profiles** - Brand-specific data (company info, industry, etc.)
- **campaigns** - Brand campaigns with requirements and budgets
- **campaign_applications** - Creator applications to campaigns

#### Relationships
- Users can be either brands or creators (determined by `user_type`)
- Campaigns belong to brands (`brand_user_id`)
- Applications connect creators to campaigns
- Profiles are automatically created on user signup

### Database Management

#### Local Development
```bash
# Start local Supabase instance
npm run db:start

# Check status
npm run db:status

# Stop local instance
npm run db:stop
```

#### Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
npm run db:migrate migration_name

# Apply migrations
npm run db:push

# Reset database
npm run db:reset
```

#### Type Generation
```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from schema
npm run db:generate-types
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS policies configured:

- **profiles**: Users can view all profiles, update their own
- **creator_profiles**: Public read, creators can update their own
- **brand_profiles**: Public read, brands can update their own
- **campaigns**: Public read, brands can manage their own
- **campaign_applications**: Creators can view their applications, brands can view applications for their campaigns
